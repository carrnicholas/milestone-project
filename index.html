    <h2>A little about me...</h2>
  <div class="half-width">
    <p>I always have been interested in technology, since I was a little kid. But
      I wasn't always a developer. You could say that journey really started
      when I moved to Germany 10 days after I graduated from college. I found out
      by accident that I had a work permit and eventually landed a job at a
      software startup, partially becasue I spoke English natively, and partially
      because I had an iPhone. So I became the company's iOS software tester.</p>
    </div> <!-- close half-width -->
  <div class="half-width">
    <p>Over time, I taught myself the basics of coding and realized that I really
      enjoyed it. But I was using free resources to learn and didn't continuously
      dedicate myself to it. Eventually, I decided that if I was serious about
      learning to do this, I needed to invest money in a course. So I enrolled in
      Skillcrush's Break Into Tech blueprint. And now, here we
      are.

    <h2>Who I Help</h2>
    <p>I help solopreneurs, small businesses, and individuals improve their online
      presence. I like websites with a minimalist feel, with color schemes that go
        together well. Easy on the eyes, and easy to read. That's my style.</p>
    <p>I can code a simple website with HTML5 and CSS3 (the main languages that
      every website needs so you can see it on your computer), or I can build a
      site on Wordpress. The biggest advantage of Wordpress is that if you want
      to change the content, you can easily do this yourself. On a Wordpress
      site, your site will need onging security updates and maintenance. If
      you like, I can help with this ongoing maintenance for a monthly fee after
      your initial Wordpress site is done.</p>
    <p>If either of these sound like a service you might need, you can find the
        best ways to connect with me <a href="#connect" class="here">here</a></p>
